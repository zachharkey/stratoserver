Hi Carla,

Hope you are well even if that means busy :)  Been wanting to catch up with you. On our end we need send an invoice, but how are we doing on your end?

I do not want to bug you, in fact, the contrary!  Zach and I really enjoy working with you, Tom, and Melissa, and we are both committed to working with you guys in the long term.  

It's our secret mission to provide you guys with a way to easily centrally manage all of your brand websites.  We would propose that all of the brand sites run off of the same publishing system, a single drupal theme, yet each brand site has it's own style and content.  Like Terra, the brands would each manage their own content, yet you yall would have ability to make suggestions or changes.  Darling content that is common to all sites would be maintained in a single place, making it simple to keep up to date.
